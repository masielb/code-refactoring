Homework 1: Code Refactor Due 6/27

This homework project consisted of code refactoring which refers to the process of editing and cleaning up previously written code without altering the function of the code. Essentially, this makes the code more efficient and accessible. 

In order to achieve more efficient code, I worked to reduce the use of div tags throughout the code. In this case, I was able to eliminate all but one div tag. In their place, I was able to utilize more accurate semantic HTML elements. Another important change involved eliminating redundant styling in the css file. Several elements shared the same styling, thus it was easier to group those elements together and apply the styling once. Furthermore, image elements required alt attributes. Finally, I made sure that heading attributes fell in sequential order between my html and css files. 

Overall, this project was an excellent exercise for writing efficient code and practicing the Scout Rule of always leaving "the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it."
